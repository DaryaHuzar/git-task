Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Remember me for centuries
Mama, fight my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong the story's aloof
Heavy metal, rock my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
I'm cruising on your thighs, leave my fingerprints
And this is for tonight
I thought that you would feel
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Remember me for centuries
